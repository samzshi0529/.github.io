## About Me 
Hello, I am Sam Shi, 施展. I'm a current MSE in Data Science student at University of Pennsylvania. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Wake Forest University majoring in Mathematical Business and Computer Science. 

## Education Background

- **MSE**, Data Science, University of Pennsylvania, 2022-2024
- **B.S.**, Mathematical Business & Computer Science, Wake Forest University, 2018-2022

## Projects

1. **A Machine Learning Approach for US Mortgage Risk Analysis**:
An independent study introducing a innovative machine learning methodology to improve mortgage default risk analysis through three key approaches:
- **Interpretable Models**: We focus on developing models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, highlighting the top 10 risk-augmenting features that influence mortgage risks.
- **LSTM-based Predictions**: We demonstrate the efficacy of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based model in generating reliable predictions from limited data sets.
- **Loan-Level Framework**: A new framework at the loan level is proposed for a more nuanced assessment of mortgage risks.
