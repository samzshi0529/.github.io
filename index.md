### A Machine Learning Approach for US Mortgage Risk Analysis

This repository contains the source code and datasets for a independent study focused on enhancing mortgage risk analysis. Our study is motivated by the significant impact that MBS can have on the broader economy, as was evident during the 2008 financial crisis. We address the challenges in current public studies which often lack explainability or rely on extensive data for accurate predictions.
